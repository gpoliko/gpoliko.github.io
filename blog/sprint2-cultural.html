                    <h1>My Learning Plan</h1>
                    <article>
                        <h2>Long term goals</h2>
                        <p>I envision being in a position where I am collaboratively working towards the betterment of individuals and our communities. A position where culture allows me to continuously learn, carry out acts of service, and empower others.
                            I am passionate about technology and how it can become an extension of ourselves, allowing us to become better. Whether I am a developer, leading a development team, or starting a business, I feel a career in web or software
                            development will greatly assist with my goals.</p>
                        <br/>
                        <p>Since studying a degree in computer science and software development, I can see how the future in tech is not only exciting, but also a great responsibility for those who are a part of it already. Technology is incredible and amazing.
                            However, I feel it can be even more incredible and amazing when it is used to benefit others.</p>

                        <h2>Skills I would like to develop (non-technical-human skills) while at EDA</h2>
                        <p>Time management sticks out like a sore thumb. I would describe my “methods of madness” to be likened to short, intense bursts of energy. As opposed to regular and consistent efforts. I absolutely want to kick this habit, and so
                            far, I feel using the Pomodoro Timer is making a noticeable difference.</p>

                        <h2>How I will manage my workload during this programme?</h2>
                        <p>While studying my degree, I treated my studies like a full-time job. I would leave home at 07:00am, arrive at university, grab a coffee, organise myself, and then start my day at 08:00am. Whether I had a class or not, I scheduled
                            my Monday to Friday so that I would be able to put a solid amount of time into my studies, and then clock out so that I could spend time with my family and other commitments. This is an approach that has worked well for me
                            and I will continue to use with EDA.</p>
                        <br/>
                        <p>The Pomodoro technique has been a revelation, and I enjoy the sense of pressure that comes from having to commit to a solid 30mins (this is what I have set) of work. This is something I will add to my learning toolkit.</p>

                        <h2>Seeking help</h2>
                        <p>I enjoy solving problems, therefore my natural instinct will be to research and identify a solution to my issues before seeking assistance. Should this approach yield no results, I will reach out to my cohort, and then my facilitators.
                            What I expect from the facilitators is constructive feedback on my work, being available to assist with any concerns or issues when I cannot solve them myself, and more stretch material when I need them.</p>
