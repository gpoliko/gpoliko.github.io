                        <h2>How my culture has influenced my values and identity</h2>
                        <p>Culture is such a broad concept for me. It has the power to shape environments and influence the individuals within them. Throughout my life, I have been very fortunate to be able to witness and experience various types of cultures
                            of different influences. From ethnic groups, families, religions, professions, educational, and social environments, the culture within each of these environments has complemented my personal values, and it has also given me
                            perspective on our ever-changing world.</p>
                        <br/>
                        <p>For myself, a Samoan Kiwi, Baha’i, rugby coach, husband, and father, I feel that my culture is a complete mashup of the many environments of which I have been exposed to. My Samoan heritage for instance, the values of respect,
                            honesty and gratitude are at the forefront of everything I do. Respect and honesty with others, but most importantly, respect and honesty with oneself. As a member of the Baha’i Faith, understanding that each of our capacities
                            are different further reinforces this respect for others and for oneself. It encourages me to strive for excellence in everything I do. To put others before myself, and to endeavor to carry out acts of service. Acts that contribute
                            to the creation of an environment or culture that is conducive to the growth and wellbeing of ourselves and our communities.</p>

                        <h2>Evaluation your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development and identify which of your strengths might help in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles</h2>
                        <p>Strengths</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Flexibility/Adaptability</li>
                            <li>I thrive in group/team settings, as I view them as opportunities to learn from others</li>
                            <li>I am disciplined</li>
                            <li>I am hardworking</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br/>
                        <p>Limitations</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Self-critical</li>
                            <li>Overworking and neglecting my health and wellbeing</li>
                            <li>Allowing myself to reach high stress levels</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br/>
                        <p>Working hard paired with striving for excellence is a bit of a double-edged sword. If I’m not self-aware, I overwork myself and end up burning out.</p>
