                        <h2>A time I was blocked on a simple problem</h2>
                        <p>In the JS-Olympics Kata, a simple problem that blocked me was the improper use of the JavaScript array functions. For “EVENT 1 – Bulk up”, I was using the Java language syntax to write the “for each loop”, forgetting about the
                            foreach JavaScript method. This led to getting a little blocked as I had made an assumption on how to iterate through a JavaScript array.</p>
                        <br/>
                        <p>What I learnt from this is that I needed to remove my ego and to endeavor to learn JavaScript without relying on my previous knowledge. To see this learning opportunity as a means of reinforcing my previous understandings, rather
                            than a burden of having to learn something new.</p>

                        <h2>A time where I solved a problem in an elegant way</h2>
                        <p>I don't feel like I have come up with elegant solutions to any problems. Or at least to my understanding of what an elegant solution is. I feel like an elegant solution is when our code is concise, readable and efficient.</p>
                        <br/>
                        <p>Great, the solution solves the problem. But is the solution easy to read? Are the steps involved easy to follow and understand? Is the solution slow or is it fast? Is the solution resource intensive? These are some of the questions
                            that come to mind when I think about elegant code.</p>

                        <h2>How confident am I with using the following problem solving techniques and processes?</h2>
                        <h3>Pseudocode</h3>
                        <p>Pseudocode is a technique I am very comfortable with, and it is usually the process I use when tackling a problem. Especially when dealing with logic.</p>
                        <h3>Trying Something</h3>
                        <p>I tend to “try something” as a last resort. Especially when I feel I have exhausted many possible solutions and just want to see if creativity and innovation can yield anything.</p>
                        <h3>Rubber Ducky Method</h3>
                        <p>The concept of describing a problem I am facing to an inanimate object is a practice I have never done. However, I do think out loud with my problems and debugging, which I feel might be similar.</p>
                        <h3>Reading Error Messages</h3>
                        <p>The more error messages I get, the better! I am quite confident with this technique as it allows me to identify issues in my code, or in my logic.</p>
                        <h3>Console.logging</h3>
                        <p>Console.log is my most used tool in the problem-solving toolkit.</p>
                        <h3>Googling</h3>
                        <p>Very confident with the old Google</p>
                        <h3>Asking your peers and coaches for help</h3>
                        <p>I am a bit hesitant with asking for help. Unfortunately, I did not get many opportunities to ask, and I feel it might be due to the nature of Foundations being remote, and not knowing my peers very well. I am confident that I will
                            get many opportunities to ask for help during bootcamp, and I look forward to learning from others.</p>
                        <h3>Improving your process with reflection</h3>
                        <p>Reflection has been a key component for my progress. Not only in coding, but in all my endeavors. I feel very confident with the process of reflecting on my work. However, I could do with more reflection, and I aim to practice
                            this more during bootcamp.</p>
