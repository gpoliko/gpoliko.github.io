                        <h2>Research Neuroplasticity</h2>
                        <h3>Understanding how the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h3>
                        <p>When our brain suffers a trauma or is damaged by disease, neuroplasticity reorganises the brainâ€™s structure so that it functions according to our environment, allowing it to recover. Understanding the functionality of the brain
                            and its ability to adapt through the formation of new neural connections can be incredibly motivating and encouraging.</p>
                        <br/>
                        <h3>How to engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</h3>
                        <p>As in individual with ADHD, understanding the principals of neuroplasticity helps me to see some of the symptoms as strengths. Some of these are, a willingness to take on risk, creativity and an extremely high level of focus. During
                            Bootcamp, I will also aim to put myself in uncomfortable situations, to challenge myself and to ensure that I am regularly practicing skills I currently have and want to have, as well as practicing them well.</p>
                        <br/>
                        <h3>What are some of the ways to increase neuroplasticity?</h3>
                        <p>Regular practice, and maybe some practice, and a bit of practice... Then maybe learning through the repetitiveness of practicing and trying to identify better methods of practice. Perfect practice makes perfect.</p>
                        <br/>
                        <p>Challenging ourselves is also conducive to increasing neuroplasticity.</p>

                        <h2>Research Growth Mindset</h2>
                        <h3>What is it and why is it relevant?</h3>
                        <p>A growth mindset is the idea that our capacities can be developed further. Adopting a humble posture of learning and a willingness to accept new challenges, can greatly assist in individual growth. This is relevant, especially
                            in a career where we are constantly challenged, succeeding, and failing. It allows us to see our mistakes or shortfalls as learning opportunities, instead of failures. An important aspect of having a growth mindset is active
                            reflection on oneself. Acknowledging the success, as well as identifying how we can improve.</p>
                        <br/>
                        <h3>Did anything surprise you?</h3>
                        <p>I did have a previous understanding of neuroplasticity and a growth mindset. However, the change for me was the need to apply a growth mindset with my studies. It can be easy to get complacent with previous knowledge and education.
                            This is a trap I do not want to fall into.</p>
                        <br/>
                        <h3>How will I integrate a growth mindset into my learning journey?</h3>
                        <p>The most difficult aspect for me is adopting a humble posture of learning. This is something I very conscious of. Regardless of my previous understandings or education, I will endeavor to see every activity or exercise as something
                            foreign and new, and to enjoy the process of learning.</p>
