                        <h2>What is EQ?</h2>
                        <p>Emotional intelligence or EQ (emotional quotient) is having the capacity to understand and manage our emotions in positive ways. Having an awareness of our emotions and being able to manage them can assist with relieving stress,
                            communicating effectively, and empathizing with others. It can also help individuals overcome challenges and defuse conflict.</p>
                        <br/>
                        <p>Empathizing with others is a core part of emotional intelligence. Empathy can be defined as, “the capability (or disposition) to immerse oneself in and to reflect upon the experiences, perspectives and contexts of others” (Zolzer,
                            2019). Having the capacity to empathize with others fosters interpersonal connection. This in turn allows us to evaluate or perceive how others feel, control our emotions so that we can facilitate social communication and relate
                            with others.</p>

                        <h2>How is it different from IQ?</h2>
                        <p>Intelligence Quotient or IQ is numerical value which is derived from a standardized IQ test. It measures an individual’s reasoning ability, gauging how well they can make use of information and logic to make predictions or answer
                            questions of the academic nature. Just as an individual’s IQ can determine their ability to learn, use logic and solve problems, an individual’s EQ can assist with determining whether they can be potential leaders or fantastic
                            team players. As well as being capable to work well independently.</p>

                        <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
                        <p>In a work or learning environment, interacting with other people is unavoidable. It is important to note that an individual or team’s success also requires attributes which may not fall under the category of “brain smarts” or intelligence.
                            It also requires diligence, perseverance, persistence, and a capacity to understand, empathize, and relate with others.</p>
