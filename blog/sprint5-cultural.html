        <h2>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>I am conscious of the effort that I to put into adopting a growth mindset. I have to talk myself into it and really push myself. A growth mindset is something I need a lot of work on.</li>
            <li>Often, I tend to set unrealistic expectations of myself.</li>
            <li>I am getting better with my reflective practice. I absolutely love reflection.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>What is the role of values, empathy and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
        <p>I believe my values of respect, gratitude, honesty, and service will be key in my learning and programming. Integrity is something that comes to mind, and it’s a constant reminder to put my values into practice instead of just “naming” them.</p>
        <p>Empathy allows me to work with others in a constructive way. It encourages me to be open minded when working with people from different backgrounds, and to take these experiences into my work and learning.</p>
        <p>Self-awareness is incredibly important when working as a developer, as it allows us to reflect and improve with every new encounter we may come across. Being self-aware allows us to grow from our experiences and in turn support others with theirs.</p>

        <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
        <p>The amount of core learning that we got to do compared to my previous studies. Everything in my previous education was mostly technical whereas the emphasis on core learning with EDA was not only surprising, but very appealing.</p>

        <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
        <p>Actively applying what was learnt during core learning and putting it into practice were the most challenging aspects for me. Especially when we are working remotely. I feel it is difficult to engage and interact with others meaningfully when
            online.

        <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h2>
        <p>From what I have learnt, the core skills are more important than technical skills. Because technical skills can be taught whereas core skills need to be strengthened through engagement with others and active reflection.</p>

        <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practice programming instead?</h2>
        <p>Definitely not. Understanding how to learn, work, struggle, and engage with others is not only conducive to personal growth, but it can have a rippling effect on how we develop our technical skills. </p>
