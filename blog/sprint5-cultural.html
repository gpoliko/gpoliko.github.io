                        <h2>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h2>
                        <ol>
                            <li>I am conscious of the effort that I to put into adopting a growth mindset. I have to talk myself into it and really push myself. A growth mindset is something I need a lot of work on.</li>
                            <li>Often, I tend to set unrealistic expectations of myself.</li>
                            <li>I am getting better with my reflective practice. I absolutely love reflection.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h2>What is the role of values, empathy and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
                        <p>I believe my values of respect, gratitude, honesty, and service will be key in my learning and programming. Integrity is something that comes to mind, and it’s a constant reminder to put my values into practice instead of just
                            “naming” them.</p>
                        <p>Empathy allows me to work with others in a constructive way. It encourages me to be open minded when working with people from different backgrounds, and to take these experiences into my work and learning.</p>
                        <p>Self-awareness is incredibly important when working as a developer, as it allows us to reflect and improve with every new encounter we may come across. Being self-aware allows us to grow from our experiences and in turn support
                            others with theirs.</p>

                        <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
                        <p>The amount of core learning that we got to do compared to my previous studies. Everything in my previous education was mostly technical whereas the emphasis on core learning with EDA was not only surprising, but very appealing.</p>

                        <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
                        <p>Actively applying what was learnt during core learning and putting it into practice were the most challenging aspects for me. Especially when we are working remotely. I feel it is difficult to engage and interact with others meaningfully
                            when online.

                        <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h2>
                        <p>From what I have learnt, the core skills are more important than technical skills. Because technical skills can be taught whereas core skills need to be strengthened through engagement with others and active reflection.</p>

                        <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practice programming instead?</h2>
                        <p>Definitely not. Understanding how to learn, work, struggle, and engage with others is not only conducive to personal growth, but it can have a rippling effect on how we develop our technical skills. </p>

                        <h3>What are you hoping to use the skills you gain during this course for?</h3>
                        <p>I want to be able to contribute and learn effectively in a high-functioning environment. To be able engage and interact with others in ways that will encourage growth. I want to have the capacity to write great code and be able
                            to contribute to the development of solutions to some of our big problems.</p>
                        <h3>What sort of impact would you like to make once you leave Dev Academy?</h3>
                        <p>Maybe after a couple of years, I would love to start a business with the focus on providing services that benefit others.</p>
                        <h3>Do you have a destination in mind?</h3>
                        <p>Hard to say at this stage. I have a real keen interest in blockchain technologies and working within this space. However, with the covid pandemic, a foot in the tech industry door would be a great start. </p>

                        <h2>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h2>
                        <p>My strengths and limitations in relation to my learning and career development will also be very relevant during Bootcamp. But at the same time, I feel that there has been a lot of learning over the last 5 weeks. Learning to be
                            patient with myself and having an appreciation for the things I do achieve, regardless of size, has been eye opening.</p>
                        <h3>How do you think these will help/hinder you during Bootcamp?</h3>
                        <p>I feel the discipline can play out as both helpful and as a hinderance. I do not want to impose or set expectations on others. I’ll need to be mindful of this and to treat it as an opportunity to be more empathetic and understanding
                            of others.</p>

                        <h2>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h2>
                        <p>Dealing with stress. I understand the intensity of Bootcamp and the pace at which we will be working at. The thought of not being able to grasp certain concepts or get work done always looms over me. This sometimes pushes me, or,
                            when that thought becomes a reality, it really affects how I am feeling. So being self-aware, and patient with myself will be important. As well as asking for help from my peers and facilitators when I do get blocked.</p>

                        <h2>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h2>
                        <p>People are an integral part of any organisation, and I want to develop skills that will allow me to assist with growing people. Whether that’s getting better at giving and receiving feedback, better communication with my peers,
                            encouraging them, showing kindness and empathy, and trying to get the best out of them.</p>

                        <h3>Based on your knowledge of Bootcamp, how and where will you seek help in a timely way?</h3>
                        <p>I believe EDA endeavors to create an environment that not just supportive, but also safe and understanding. So I feel there will be a lot of assistance that we’ll have access to. It’s important that I am seeking help from my facilitators
                            as soon as possible when I am getting blocked. But also being comfortable to seek help from my peers.</p>
                        <br/>
                        <p>Currently, I have a few commitments which I juggle throughout the week. With the help of my wife, we plan out our weeks to ensure nothing surprises us. I will continue to do this to ensure I am making the most of my time and where
                            possible allocating extra time to EDA.</p>
